                                At the first week  our teachers introduced tools that we will use them as a web develpoer.Like as vscode and its terminal and some site for practice coding like as codewars. After that they explained about high and low level programming languages and node.js
                                Also they started to teach javascript and "console.log()" was first thing we learned.

                                I found a lot of solutions while I practiced js on codewars site. Also I used my research skills.
                                Before coding I tried to imagine my solution by algorithmic and logical thinking.

                            <p>Sometimes I had no good solution for solving js tasks, I found that I should review js array methods to solve js tasks by best practice code.Also research skills helped me.</p>
